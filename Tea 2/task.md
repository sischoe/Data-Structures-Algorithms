Numbers can be provided in various formats in C++. Literals prefixed with 0b indicate binary encoding. Assume unsigned arithmetics with sufficient numbers of bits, i.e. no overflows. Convert the following binary numbers into decimal numbers (1-4) and decimal numbers to binary (5-8):

# Lines starting with # are comments. Spaces is ignored.

# Convert to decimal:
0b1           = ?


0b10          = ?


0b000001      = ?

0b101010      = ?

# Convert to binary:

7             = ?

11            = ?

28            = ?

1024          = ?
